 Couple of years ago, I came to Finland for my MS.c in Geoinformatics at the University of Helsinki, where, I mostly studied geospatial modelling, remote sensing, analysis and data visualisations. Therein, I used tools like R, python, QGIS and lastools. 

                At some point, I had some side project ideas and I needed to build them myself. This veered me towards software development and I fell in love with it. Because I had to develop the web, cross-platform mobile (perhaps desktop too), and the backend;  choosing Javascript/Typescript was a no-brainer. 

             During my leisure, I like to apply my data analytics and software knowledge in working on my three long-term side projects. This is just a way to keep myself curious, up-to-date and passionate about software development. I also have a couple of youtube channels where I do tutorials and vlogging about programming.
